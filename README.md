## DVD-Rental-SQL
# In this project I worked on a DVD rental business dataset. The objective was to (i) Build a Data Warehouse as per the kind of analysis I wanted to do (ii) Secondly, extract insights from data by building KPIs  (iii) Visualising 5 of those KPIs in a Tableau Dashboard

With this data warehouse, we will focus on analyzing film categories across different domains. Key insights will include identifying top-performing categories in terms of revenue and turnover rate, allowing for targeted marketing and inventory decisions. We will analyze seasonality, understanding how sales of categories like Animation, Sci-Fi, and Drama fluctuate during different seasons (e.g., Summer vs. Winter). Additionally, we will explore rental durations to identify which categories tend to have longer rentals, providing insights into customer preferences. Comparing category performance across stores will help determine the best-performing locations for specific categories, guiding strategic decisions for each store.

1)	QUESTION: What are the top film categories by sales for each store?

# INTERPRETATION: 
The table provides insights into category-wise sales performance across two stores. A clear trend emerges where Sports, Animation, and Drama categories generate high revenue in both stores, suggesting strong customer demand for these genres. However, Store 2 consistently records higher sales across top categories, indicating a larger customer base, higher rental frequency, or a more effective marketing strategy compared to Store 1.
Additionally, Store 2 includes Documentary as a significant revenue-generating category, whereas Store 1 does not, suggesting a differentiated inventory strategy or customer preference variations between the two locations. This insight could guide inventory adjustments for Store 1 to explore demand for documentaries.
From a business perspective, these findings highlight potential actions such as boosting inventory for high-performing categories, conducting customer preference analysis to understand Store 2â€™s advantage, and testing the Documentary category in Store 1 to expand its offering. Understanding these patterns can help optimize revenue and improve store-specific strategies.
